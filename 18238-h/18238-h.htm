<h3><a id="VAGABONDIA" name="VAGABONDIA"></a>VAGABONDIA.</h3>

<p>
Off with the fetters
<br />That chafe and restrain!
<br />Off with the chain!
<br />Here Art and Letters,
<br />Music and wine,
<br />And Myrtle and Wanda,
<br />The winsome witches,
<br />Blithely combine.
<br />Here are true riches,
<br />Here is Golconda,
<br />Here are the Indies,
<br />Here we are free&mdash;
<br />Free as the wind is,
<br />Free, as the sea.
<br />Free!
<br />
<br />Houp-la!
<br />
<br />What have we
<br />To do with the way
<br />Of the Pharisee?
<br />We go or we stay
<br />At our own sweet will;
<br />We think as we say,
<br />And we say or keep still
<br />At our own sweet will,
<br />At our own sweet will.
<br />
<br />Here we are free
<br />To be good or bad,
<br />Sane or mad,
<br />Merry or grim
<br />As the mood may be,&mdash;
<br />Free as the whim
<br />Of a spook on a spree,&mdash;
<br />Free to be oddities,
<br />Not mere commodities,
<br />Stupid and salable,
<br />Wholly available,
<br />Ranged upon shelves;
<br />Each with his puny form
<br />In the same uniform,
<br />Cramped and disabled;
<br />We are not labelled,
<br />We are ourselves.
<br />
<br />Here is the real,
<br />Here the ideal;
<br />Laughable hardship
<br />Met and forgot,
<br />Glory of bardship&mdash;
<br />World's bloom and world's blot;
<br />The shock and the jostle,
<br />The mock and the push,
<br />But hearts like the throstle
<br />A-joy in the bush;
<br />Wits that would merrily
<br />Laugh away wrong,
<br />Throats that would verily
<br />Melt Hell in Song.
<br />
<br />What though the dimes be
<br />Elusive as rhymes be,
<br />And Bessie, with finger
<br />Uplifted, is warning
<br />That breakfast next morning
<br />(A subject she's scorning)
<br />Is mighty uncertain!
<br />
<br />What care we? Linger
<br />A moment to kiss&mdash;
<br />No time's amiss
<br />To a vagabond's ardor&mdash;
<br />Thee finish the larder
<br />And pull down the curtain.
<br />
<br />Unless ere the kiss come,
<br />Black Richard or Bliss come,
<br />Or Tom with a flagon,
<br />Or Karl with a jag on&mdash;
<br />Then up and after
<br />The joy of the night
<br />With the hounds of laughter
<br />To follow the flight
<br />Of the fox-foot hours
<br />That double and run
<br />Through brakes and bowers
<br />Of folly and fun.
<br />
<br />With the comrade heart
<br />For a moment's play,
<br />And the comrade heart
<br />For a heavier day,
<br />And the comrade heart
<br />Forever and aye.
<br />
<br />For the joy of wine
<br />Is not for long;
<br />And the joy of song
<br />Is a dream of shine;
<br />But the comrade heart
<br />Shall outlast art
<br />And a woman's love
<br />The fame thereof.
<br />
<br />But wine for a sign
<br />Of the love we bring!
<br />And song for an oath
<br />That Love is king!
<br />And both, and both
<br />For his worshipping!
<br />
<br />Then up and away
<br />Till the break of day,
<br />With a heart that's merry,
<br />And a Tom-and-Jerry,
<br />And a derry-down-derry&mdash;
<br />What's that you say.
<br />You highly respectable
<br />Buyers and sellers?
<br />We should be decenter?
<br />Not as we please inter
<br />Custom, frugality,
<br />Use and morality
<br />In the delectable
<br />Depths of wine-cellars?
<br />
<br />Midnights of revel,
<br />And noondays of song!
<br />Is it so wrong?
<br />Go to the Devil!
<br />
<br />I tell you that we,
<br />While you are smirking
<br />And lying and shirking
<br />life's duty of duties,
<br />Honest sincerity,
<br />We are in verity
<br />Free!
<br />Free to rejoice
<br />
<br />In blisses and beauties!
<br />Free as the voice
<br />Of the wind as it passes!
<br />Free as the bird
<br />In the weft of the grasses!
<br />Free as the word
<br />Of the sun to the sea&mdash;
<br />Free!
</p>


<h3><a id="A_WAIF" name="A_WAIF"></a>A WAIF.</h3>

<p>
Do you know what it is to be vagrant born?
<br />A waif is only a waif. And so,
<br />For another idle hour I sit,
<br />In large content while the fire burns low.
<br />
<br />I gossip here to my crony heart
<br />Of the day just over, and count it one
<br />Of the royal elemental days,
<br />Though its dreams were few and its deeds were none.
<br />
<br />Outside, the winter; inside, the warmth
<br />And a sweet oblivion of turmoil. Why?
<br />All for a gentle girlish hand
<br />With its warm and lingering good-bye.
</p>


<h3><a id="THE_JOYS_OF_THE_ROAD" name="THE_JOYS_OF_THE_ROAD"></a>THE JOYS OF THE ROAD.</h3>

<p>
Now the joys of the road are chiefly these:
<br />A crimson touch on the hard-wood trees;
<br />
<br />A vagrant's morning wide and blue,
<br />In early fall when the wind walks, too;
<br />
<br />A shadowy highway cool and brown,
<br />Alluring up and enticing down
<br />
<br />From rippled water to dappled swamp,
<br />From purple glory to scarlet pomp;
<br />
<br />The outward eye, the quiet will,
<br />And the striding heart from hill to hill;
<br />
<br />The tempter apple over the fence;
<br />The cobweb bloom on the yellow quince;
<br />
<br />The palish asters along the wood,&mdash;
<br />A lyric touch of the solitude;
<br />
<br />An open hand, an easy shoe.
<br />And a hope to make the day go through,&mdash;
<br />
<br />Another to sleep with, and a third
<br />To wake me up at the voice of a bird;
<br />
<br />The resonant far-listening morn,
<br />And the hoarse whisper of the corn;
<br />
<br />The crickets mourning their comrades lost,
<br />In the night's retreat from the gathering frost;
<br />
<br />(Or is it their slogan, plaintive and shrill,
<br />As they beat on their corselets, valiant still?)
<br />
<br />A hunger fit for the kings of the sea,
<br />And a loaf of bread for Dickon and me;
<br />
<br />A thirst like that of the Thirsty Sword,
<br />And a jug of cider on the board;
<br />
<br />An idle noon, a bubbling spring,
<br />The sea in the pine-tops murmuring;
<br />
<br />A scrap of gossip at the ferry;
<br />A comrade neither glum nor merry,
<br />
<br />Asking nothing, revealing naught,
<br />But minting his words from a fund of thought,
<br />
<br />A keeper of silence eloquent,
<br />Needy, yet royally well content,
<br />
<br />Of the mettled breed, yet abhorring strife,
<br />And full of the mellow juice of life;
<br />
<br />A taster of wine, with an eye for a maid,
<br />Never too bold, and never afraid,
<br />
<br />Never heart-whole, never heart-sick,
<br />(These are the things I worship in Dick)
<br />
<br />No fidget and no reformer, just
<br />A calm observer of ought and must,
<br />
<br />A lover of books, but a reader of man,
<br />No cynic and no charlatan,
<br />
<br />Who never defers and never demands,
<br />But, smiling, takes the world in his hands,&mdash;
<br />
<br />Seeing it good as when God first saw
<br />And gave it the weight of his will for law.
<br />
<br />And O the joy that is never won,
<br />But follows and follows the journeying sun,
<br />
<br />By marsh and tide, by meadow and stream,
<br />A will-o'-the-wind, a light-o'-dream,
<br />
<br />Delusion afar, delight anear,
<br />From morrow to morrow, from year to year,
<br />
<br />A jack-o'-lantern, a fairy fire,
<br />A dare, a bliss, and a desire!
<br />
<br />The racy smell of the forest loam,
<br />When the stealthy, sad-heart leaves go home;
<br />
<br />(O leaves, O leaves, I am one with you,
<br />Of the mould and the sun and the wind and the dew!)
<br />
<br />The broad gold wake of the afternoon;
<br />The silent fleck of the cold new moon;
<br />
<br />The sound of the hollow sea's release
<br />From stormy tumult to starry peace;
<br />
<br />With only another league to wend;
<br />And two brown arms at the journey's end!
<br />
<br />These are the joys of the open road&mdash;
<br />For him who travels without a load.
</p>


<h3><a id="EVENING_ON_THE_POTOMAC" name="EVENING_ON_THE_POTOMAC"></a>EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.</h3>

<p>
The fervid breath of our flushed Southern May
<br />Is sweet upon the city's throat and lips,
<br />As a lover's whose tired arm slips
<br />Listlessly over the shoulder of a queen.
<br />
<br />Far away
<br />The river melts in the unseen.
<br />Oh, beautiful Girl-City, how she dips
<br />Her feet in the stream
<br />With a touch that is half a kiss and half a dream!
<br />Her face is very fair,
<br />With flowers for smiles and sunlight in her hair.
<br />
<br />My westland flower-town, how serene she is!
<br />Here on this hill from which I look at her,
<br />All is still as if a worshipper
<br />Left at some shrine his offering.
<br />
<br />Soft winds kiss
<br />My cheek with a slow lingering.
<br />A luring whisper where the laurels stir
<br />Wiles my heart back to woodland-ward again.
<br />
<br />But lo,
<br />Across the sky the sunset couriers run,
<br />And I remain
<br />To watch the imperial pageant of the Sun
<br />Mock me, an impotent Cortez here below,
<br />With splendors of its vaster Mexico.
<br />
<br />O Eldorado of the templed clouds!
<br />O golden city of the western sky!
<br />Not like the Spaniard would I storm thy gates;
<br />Not like the babe stretch chubby hands and cry
<br />
<br />To have thee for a toy; but far from crowds,
<br />Like my Faun brother in the ferny glen,
<br />Peer from the wood's edge while thy glory waits,
<br />And in the darkening thickets plunge again.
</p>


<h3><a id="SPRING_SONG" name="SPRING_SONG"></a>SPRING SONG.</h3>

<p>
Make me over, mother April,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />When thy flowery hand delivers
<br />All the mountain-prisoned rivers,
<br />And thy great heart beats and quivers,
<br />To revive the days that were,
<br />Make me over, mother April,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />
<br />Take my dust and all my dreaming,
<br />Count my heart-beats one by one,
<br />Send them where the winters perish;
<br />Then some golden noon recherish
<br />And restore them in the sun,
<br />Flower and scent and dust and dreaming,
<br />With their heart-beats every one!
<br />
<br />Set me in the urge and tide-drift
<br />Of the streaming hosts a-wing!
<br />Breast of scarlet, throat of yellow,
<br />Raucous challenge, wooings mellow&mdash;
<br />Every migrant is my fellow,
<br />Making northward with the spring.
<br />Loose me in the urge and tide-drift
<br />Of the streaming hosts a-wing!
<br />
<br />Shrilling pipe or fluting whistle,
<br />In the valleys come again;
<br />Fife of frog and call of tree-toad,
<br />All my brothers, five or three-toed,
<br />With their revel no more vetoed,
<br />Making music in the rain;
<br />Shrilling pipe or fluting whistle,
<br />In the valleys come again.
<br />
<br />Make me of thy seed to-morrow,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />Tawny light-foot, sleepy bruin,
<br />Bright-eyes in the orchard ruin,
<br />Gnarl the good life goes askew in,
<br />Whiskey-jack, or tanager,&mdash;
<br />Make me anything to-morrow,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />
<br />Make me even (How do I know?)
<br />Like my friend the gargoyle there;
<br />It may be the heart within him
<br />Swells that doltish hands should pin him
<br />Fixed forever in mid-air.
<br />Make me even sport for swallows,
<br />Like the soaring gargoyle there!
<br />
<br />Give me the old clue to follow,
<br />Through the labyrinth of night!
<br />Clod of clay with heart of fire,
<br />Things that burrow and aspire,
<br />With the vanishing desire,
<br />For the perishing delight,&mdash;
<br />Only the old clue to follow,
<br />Through the labyrinth of night!
<br />
<br />Make me over, mother April,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />Fashion me from swamp or meadow,
<br />Garden plot or ferny shadow,
<br />Hyacinth or humble burr!
<br />Make me over, mother April,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />
<br />Let me hear the far, low summons,
<br />When the silver winds return;
<br />Rills that run and streams that stammer,
<br />Goldenwing with his loud hammer,
<br />Icy brooks that brawl and clamor,
<br />Where the Indian willows burn;
<br />Let me hearken to the calling,
<br />When the silver winds return,
<br />
<br />Till recurring and recurring,
<br />Long since wandered and come back,
<br />Like a whim of Grieg's or Gounod's,
<br />This same self, bird, bud, or Bluenose,
<br />Some day I may capture (Who knows?)
<br />Just the one last joy I lack,
<br />Waking to the far new summons,
<br />When the old spring winds come back.
<br />
<br />For I have no choice of being,
<br />When the sap begins to climb,&mdash;
<br />Strong insistence, sweet intrusion,
<br />Vasts and verges of illusion,&mdash;
<br />So I win, to time's confusion,
<br />The one perfect pearl of time,
<br />Joy and joy and joy forever,
<br />Till the sap forgets to climb!
<br />
<br />Make me over in the morning
<br />From the rag-bag of the world!
<br />Scraps of dream and duds of daring,
<br />Home-brought stuff from far sea-faring,
<br />Faded colors once so flaring,
<br />Shreds of banners long since furled!
<br />Hues of ash and glints of glory,
<br />In the rag-bag of the world!
<br />
<br />Let me taste the old immortal
<br />Indolence of life once more;
<br />Not recalling nor foreseeing,
<br />Let the great slow joys of being
<br />Well my heart through as of yore!
<br />Let me taste the old immortal
<br />Indolence of life once more!
<br />
<br />Give me the old drink for rapture,
<br />The delirium to drain,
<br />All my fellows drank in plenty
<br />At the Three Score Inns and Twenty
<br />From the mountains to the main!
<br />Give me the old drink for rapture,
<br />The delirium to drain!
<br />
<br />Only make me over, April,
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
<br />Make me man or make me woman,
<br />Make me oaf or ape or human,
<br />Cup of flower or cone of fir;
<br />Make me anything but neuter
<br />When the sap begins to stir!
</p>


<h3><a id="THE_FAUN" name="THE_FAUN"></a>THE FAUN. <span class="smaller">A FRAGMENT.</span></h3>

<p>
I will go out to grass with that old King,
<br />For I am weary of clothes and cooks.
<br />I long to lie along the banks of brooks,
<br />And watch the boughs above me sway and swing.
<br />Come, I will pluck off custom's livery,
<br />Nor longer be a lackey to old Time.
<br />Time shall serve me, and at my feet shall fling
<br />The spoil of listless minutes. I shall climb
<br />The wild trees for my food, and run
<br />Through dale and upland as a fox runs free,
<br />Laugh for cool joy and sleep i' the warm sun,
<br />And men will call me mad, like that old King.
<br />
<br />For I am woodland-natured, and have made
<br />Dryads my bedfellows,
<br />And I have played
<br />With the sleek Naiads in the splash of pools
<br />And made a mock of gowned and trousered fools.
<br />Helen, none knows
<br />Better than thou how like a Faun I strayed.
<br />And I am half Faun now, and my heart goes
<br />Out to the forest and the crack of twigs,
<br />The drip of wet leaves and the low soft laughter
<br />Of brooks that chuckle o'er old mossy jests
<br />And say them over to themselves, the nests
<br />Of squirrels and the holes the chipmunk digs,
<br />Where through the branches the slant rays
<br />Dapple with sunlight the leaf-matted ground,
<br />And the wind comes with blown vesture rustling after,
<br />And through the woven lattice of crisp sound
<br />A bird's song lightens like a maiden's face.
<br />
<br />O wildwood Helen, let them strive and fret,
<br />Those goggled men with their dissecting-knives!
<br />
<br />Let them in charnel-houses pass their lives
<br />And seek in death life's secret! And let
<br />Those hard-faced worldlings prematurely old
<br />Gnaw their thin lips with vain desire to get
<br />Portia's fair fame or Lesbia's carcanet,
<br />Or crown of Caesar or Catullus,
<br />Apicius' lampreys or Crassus' gold!
<br />For these consider many things&mdash;but yet
<br />By land nor sea
<br />They shall not find the way to Arcady,
<br />The old home of the awful heart-dear Mother,
<br />Whereto child-dreams and long rememberings lull us,
<br />Far from the cares that overlay and smother
<br />The memories of old woodland out-door mirth
<br />In the dim first life-burst centuries ago,
<br />The sense of the freedom and nearness of Earth&mdash;
<br />Nay, this they shall not know;
<br />For who goes thither,
<br />Leaves all the cark and clutch of his soul behind,
<br />The doves defiled and the serpents shrined,
<br />The hates that wax and the hopes that wither;
<br />Nor does he journey, seeking where it be,
<br />But wakes and finds himself in Arcady.
<br />
<br />Hist! there's a stir in the brush.
<br />Was it a face through the leaves?
<br />Back of the laurels a skurry and rush
<br />Hillward, then silence except for the thrush
<br />That throws one song from the dark of the bush
<br />And is gone; and I plunge in the wood, and the swift soul cleaves
<br />Through the swirl and the flow of the leaves,
<br />As a swimmer stands with his white limbs bare to the sun
<br />For the space that a breath is held, and drops in the sea;
<br />And the undulant woodland folds round me, intimate, fluctuant, free,
<br />Like the clasp and the cling of waters, and the reach and the effort is done,&mdash;
<br />There is only the glory of living, exultant to be.
<br />
<br />O goodly damp smell of the ground!
<br />O rough sweet bark of the trees!
<br />O clear sharp cracklings of sound!
<br />O life that's a-thrill and a-bound
<br />With the vigor of boyhood and morning, and the noontide's rapture of ease!
<br />Was there ever a weary heart in the world?
<br />A lag in the body's urge or a flag of the spirit's wings?
<br />Did a man's heart ever break
<br />For a lost hope's sake?
<br />For here there is lilt in the quiet and calm in the quiver of things.
<br />Ay, this old oak, gray-grown and knurled,
<br />Solemn and sturdy and big,
<br />Is as young of heart, as alert and elate in his rest,
<br />As the nuthatch there that clings to the tip of the twig
<br />And scolds at the wind that it buffets too rudely its nest.
<br />
<br />Oh, what is it breathes in the air?
<br />Oh, what is it touches my cheek?
<br />There's a sense of a presence that lurks in the branches.
<br />But where?
<br />Is it far, is it far to seek?

When the bugler morn shall wind his horn,

<br />And stare at the selfsame sea?
<br />O new, new day! though you bring no stay
<br />To the strain of the sameness grim,
<br />You are new, new, new&mdash;new through and through,
<br />And strange as a lawless dream.
<br />
<br />Will the driftwood float by the lonely boat
<br />And our prisoner hearts unbar,

<br />That lies not far, not far?

<br />You are new, new, new&mdash;with the promise true

<br />O new despair! I though the hopeless air
<br />Grow foul with the calm and grieves,
<br />You are new, new, new&mdash;and we cleave to you

<br />O strange new gloom! we await the doom,

<br />Shall the lookout call from the foretop tall,

<p>
The swarthy bee is a buccaneer,
<br />A burly velveted rover,
<br />Who loves the booming wind in his ear
<br />As he sails the seas of clover.
<br />
<br />A waif of the goblin pirate crew,
<br />With not a soul to deplore him,
<br />He steers for the open verge of blue
<br />With the filmy world before him.
<br />
<br />His flimsy sails abroad on the wind
<br />Are shivered with fairy thunder;
<br />On a line that sings to the light of his wings
<br />He makes for the lands of wonder.
<br />
<br />He harries the ports of the Hollyhocks,
<br />And levies on poor Sweetbrier;
<br />He drinks the whitest wine of Phlox,
<br />And the Rose is his desire.
<br />
<br />He hangs in the Willows a night and a day;
<br />He rifles the Buckwheat patches;
<br />Then battens his store of pelf galore
<br />Under the tautest hatches.
<br />
<br />He woos the Poppy and weds the Peach,
<br />Inveigles Daffodilly,
<br />And then like a tramp abandons each
<br />For the gorgeous Canada Lily.
<br />
<br />There's not a soul in the garden world
<br />But wishes the day were shorter,
<br />When Mariner B. puts out to sea
<br />With the wind in the proper quarter.
<br />
<br />Or, so they say! But I have my doubts;
<br />For the flowers are only human,
<br />And the valor and gold of a vagrant bold
<br />Were always dear to woman.
<br />
<br />He dares to boast, along the coast,
<br />The beauty of Highland Heather,&mdash;
<br />How he and she, with night on the sea,
<br />Lay out on the hills together.
<br />
<br />He pilfers from every port of the wind,
<br />From April to golden autumn;
<br />But the thieving ways of his mortal days
<br />Are those his mother taught him.
<br />
<br />His morals are mixed, but his will is fixed;
<br />He prospers after his kind,
<br />And follows an instinct, compass-sure,
<br />The philosophers call blind.
<br />
<br />And that is why, when he comes to die,
<br />He'll have an easier sentence
<br />Than some one I know who thinks just so,
<br />And then leaves room for repentance.
<br />
<br />He never could box the compass round;
<br />He doesn't know port from starboard;
<br />But he knows the gates of the Sundown Straits,
<br />Where the choicest goods are harbored.
<br />
<br />He never could see the Rule of Three,
<br />But he knows a rule of thumb
<br />Better than Euclid's, better than yours,
<br />Or the teachers' yet to come.
<br />
<br />He knows the smell of the hydromel
<br />As if two and two were five;
<br />And hides it away for a year and a day
<br />In his own hexagonal hive.
<br />
<br />Out in the day, hap-hazard, alone,
<br />Booms the old vagrant hummer,
<br />With only his whim to pilot him
<br />Through the splendid vast of summer.
<br />
<br />He steers and steers on the slant of the gale,
<br />Like the fiend or Vanderdecken;
<br />And there's never an unknown course to sail
<br />But his crazy log can reckon.
<br />
<br />He drones along with his rough sea-song
<br />And the throat of a salty tar,
<br />This devil-may-care, till he makes his lair
<br />By the light of a yellow star.
<br />
<br />He looks like a gentleman, lives like a lord,
<br />And works like a Trojan hero;
<br />Then loafs all winter upon his hoard,
<br />With the mercury at zero.

<br />A beacon-light far off,
<br />Twinkling across the waves like a star!
<br />But no star in the dark overhead!
<br />The splash of waters at the prow, and the evil light
<br />Of the death-fires flitting like will-o'-the-wisps beneath! And beyond

<br />I sit by the taffrail,
<br />Alone in the dark and the blown cold mist and the spray,
<br />Feeling myself swept on irresistibly,
<br />Sunk in the night and the sea, and made one with their footfall-less onrush,
<br />Letting myself be borne like a spar adrift
<br />Helplessly into the night.
<br />
<br />Without fear, without wish,
<br />Insensate save of a dull, crushed ache in my heart,
<br />Careless whither the steamer is going,
<br />Conscious only as in a dream of the wet and the dark
<br />And of a form that looms and fades indistinctly
<br />Everywhere out of the night.
<br />
<br />O love, how came I here?
<br />Shall I wake at thy side and smile at my dream?
<br />The dream that grips me so hard that I cannot wake nor stir!
<br />O love! O my own love, found but to be lost!
<br />My soul sends over the waters a wild inarticulate cry,
<br />Like a gull's scream heard in the night.
<br />
<br />The mist creeps closer. The beacon
<br />Vanishes astern. The sea's monotonous noises
<br />Lapse through the drizzle with a listless, subsiding cadence.
<br />And thou, O love, and the sea throb on in my brain together,
<br />While the steamer plunges along,
<br />Butting its way through the night.

<br />It seemed unmanly in my sight

<br />It angered me&mdash;I did him wrong&mdash;

<br />Through the twilight with a song.
<br />
<br />Leering closer, rank and girding,
<br />In this Black Port where we bide,
<br />Reel a thousand flaring faces;
<br />But escape is on the tide.
<br />
<br />Let the tap-rooms of the city
<br />Reek till the red dawn comes round.
<br />There is better wine in plenty
<br />On the cruise where we are bound.
<br />
<br />I've aboard a hundred messmates
<br />Better than these 'long-shore knaves.
<br />There is wreckage on the shallows;
<br />It's the open sea that saves.
<br />
<br />Hark, lad, dost not hear it calling?
<br />That's the voice thy father knew,
<br />When he took the King's good cutlass
<br />In his grip, and fought it through.
<br />
<br />Who would palter at press-money
<br />When he heard that sea-cry vast?
<br />That's the call makes lords of lubbers,
<br />When they ship before the mast.
<br />
<br />Let thy cronies of the tavern
<br />Keep their kisses bought with gold;
<br />On the high seas there are regions
<br />Where the heart is never old,
<br />
<br />Where the great winds every morning
<br />Sweep the sea-floor clean and white,
<br />And upon the steel-blue arches
<br />Burnish the great stars of night;
<br />
<br />There the open hand will lose not,
<br />Nor the loosened tongue betray.
<br />Signed, and with our sailing orders,
<br />We will clear before the day;
<br />
<br />On the shining yards of heaven
<br />See a wider dawn unfurled....
<br />The eternal slaves of beauty
<br />Are the masters of the world.

Oh, not for us the easy mirth
<br />Of men that never roam!
<br />The crackling of the narrow hearth,
<br />The cabined joys of home!
<br />Keep your tame, regulated glee,
<br />O pale protected State!
<br />Our dwelling-place is on the sea,
<br />Our joy the joy of Fate!
<br />
<br />No long caresses give us ease,
<br />No lazy languors warm,
<br />We seize our mates as the sea-gulls seize,
<br />And leave them to the storm.
<br />But in the bridal halls of gloom
<br />The couch is stern and strait;
<br />For us the marriage rite of Doom,
<br />The nuptial joy of Fate.
<br />
<br />Wine for the weaklings of the town,
<br />Their lucky toasts to drain!
<br />Our skoal for them whose star goes down,
<br />Our drink the drink of men!
<br />No Bacchic ivy for our brows!
<br />Like vikings, we await
<br />The grim, ungarlanded carouse
<br />We keep to-night with Fate.
<br />
<br />Ho, gamesters of the pampered court!
<br />What stakes are those at strife?
<br />Your thousands are but paltry sport
<br />To them that play for life.
<br />You risk doubloons, and hold your breath.
<br />Win groats, and wax elate;
<br />But we throw loaded dice with Death,
<br />And call the turn on Fate.
<br />
<br />The kings of earth are crowned with care,
<br />Their poets wail and sigh;
<br />Our music is to do and dare,
<br />Our empire is to die.
<br />Against the storm we fling our glee
<br />And shout, till Time abate
<br />The exultation of the sea,
<br />The fearful joy of Fate.

Who'll have the crumpled pieces of a heart?

<br />Who'll give his whole of passion for a part,
<br />And call't divine?
<br />Who'll have the soiled remainder of desire?
<br />Who'll warm his fingers at a burnt-out fire?
<br />Who'll drink the lees of love, and cast i' the mire
<br />The nobler wine?
<br />
<br />Let him come here, and kiss me on the mouth,
<br />And have his will!
<br />Love dead and dry as summer in the South
<br />When winds are still
<br />And all the leafage shrivels in the heat!
<br />Let him come here and linger at my feet
<br />Till he grow weary with the over-sweet,
<br />And die, or kill.

<h3><a id="LAUNA_DEE" name="LAUNA_DEE"></a>LAUNA DEE.</h3>

<p>
Weary, oh, so weary
<br />With it all!
<br />Sunny days or dreary&mdash;
<br />How they pall!
<br />Why should we be heroes,
<br />Launa Dee,
<br />Striving to no winning?
<br />Let the world be Zero's!
<br />As in the beginning
<br />Let it be!
<br />
<br />What good comes of toiling,
<br />When all's done?
<br />Frail green sprays for spoiling
<br />Of the sun;
<br />Laurel leaf or myrtle,
<br />Love or fame&mdash;
<br />Ah, what odds what spray, sweet?
<br />Time, that makes life fertile,
<br />Makes its blooms decay, sweet,
<br />As they came.
<br />
<br />Lie here with me dreaming,
<br />Cheek to cheek,
<br />Lithe limbs twined and gleaming,
<br />Brown and sleek;
<br />Like two serpents coiling
<br />In their lair.
<br />Where's the good of wreathing
<br />Sprays for Time's despoiling?
<br />Let me feel your breathing
<br />In my hair.
<br />
<br />You and I together&mdash;
<br />Was it so?
<br />In the August weather
<br />Long ago!
<br />Did we kiss and fellow,
<br />Side by side,
<br />Till the sunbeams quickened
<br />From our stalks great yellow
<br />Sunflowers, till we sickened
<br />There and died?
<br />
<br />Were we tigers creeping
<br />Through the glade
<br />Where our prey lay sleeping,
<br />Unafraid,
<br />In some Eastern jungle?
<br />Better so.
<br />I am sure the snarling
<br />Beasts could never bungle
<br />Life as men do, darling,
<br />Who half know.
<br />
<br />Ah, if all of life, love,
<br />Were the living!
<br />Just to cease from strife, love,
<br />And from grieving;
<br />Let the swift world pass us,
<br />You and me,
<br />Stilled from all aspiring,&mdash;
<br />Sinai nor Parnassus
<br />Longer worth desiring,
<br />Launa Dee!
<br />
<br />Just to live like lilies
<br />In the lake!
<br />Where no thought nor will is,
<br />To mistake!
<br />Just to lose the human
<br />Eyes that weep!
<br />Just to cease from seeming
<br />Longer man and woman!
<br />Just to reach the dreaming
<br />And the sleep!

<h3><a id="THE_MENDICANTS" name="THE_MENDICANTS"></a>THE MENDICANTS.</h3>

<p>
We are as mendicants who wait
<br />Along the roadside in the sun.
<br />Tatters of yesterday and shreds
<br />Of morrow clothe us every one.
<br />
<br />And some are dotards, who believe
<br />And glory in the days of old;
<br />While some are dreamers, harping still
<br />Upon an unknown age of gold.
<br />
<br />Hopeless or witless! Not one heeds,
<br />As lavish Time comes down the way
<br />And tosses in the suppliant hat
<br />One great new-minted gold To-day.
<br />
<br />Ungrateful heart and grudging thanks,
<br />His beggar's wisdom only sees
<br />Housing and bread and beer enough;
<br />He knows no other things than these.
<br />
<br />O foolish ones, put by your care!
<br />Where wants are many, joys are few;
<br />And at the wilding springs of peace,
<br />God keeps an open house for you.
<br />
<br />But that some Fortunatus' gift
<br />Is lying there within his hand,
<br />More costly than a pot of pearls,
<br />His dulness does not understand.
<br />
<br />And so his creature heart is filled;
<br />His shrunken self goes starved away.
<br />Let him wear brand-new garments still,
<br />Who has a threadbare soul, I say.
<br />
<br />But there be others, happier few,
<br />The vagabondish sons of God,
<br />Who know the by-ways and the flowers,
<br />And care not how the world may plod.
<br />
<br />They idle down the traffic lands,
<br />And loiter through the woods with spring;
<br />To them the glory of the earth
<br />Is but to hear a bluebird sing.
<br />
<br />They too receive each one his Day;
<br />But their wise heart knows many things
<br />Beyond the sating of desire,
<br />Above the dignity of kings.
<br />
<br />One I remember kept his coin,
<br />And laughing flipped it in the air;
<br />But when two strolling pipe-players
<br />Came by, he tossed it to the pair.
<br />
<br />Spendthrift of joy, his childish heart
<br />Danced to their wild outlandish bars;
<br />Then supperless he laid him down
<br />That night, and slept beneath the stars.

Now gird thee well for courage,
<br />My knight of twenty year,
<br />Against the marching morrows
<br />That fill the world with fear!
<br />
<br />The flowers fade before them;
<br />The summer leaves the hill;
<br />Their trumpets range the morning,
<br />And those who hear grow still.
<br />
<br />Like pillagers of harvest,
<br />Their fame is far abroad,
<br />As gray remorseless troopers
<br />That plunder and maraud.
<br />
<br />The dust is on their corselets;
<br />Their marching fills the world;
<br />With conquest after conquest
<br />Their banners are unfurled.
<br />
<br />They overthrow the battles
<br />Of every lord of war,
<br />From world-dominioned cities
<br />Wipe out the names they bore.
<br />
<br />Sohrab, Rameses, Roland,
<br />Ramoth, Napoleon, Tyre,
<br />And the Romeward Huns of Attila&mdash;
<br />Alas, for their desire!
<br />
<br />By April and by autumn
<br />They perish in their pride,
<br />And still they close and gather
<br />Out of the mountain-side.
<br />
<br />The tanned and tameless children
<br />Of the wild elder earth,
<br />With stature of the northlights,
<br />They have the stars for girth.
<br />
<br />There's not a hand to stay them,
<br />Of all the hearts that brave;
<br />No captain to undo them,
<br />No cunning to off-stave.
<br />
<br />Yet fear thou not! If haply
<br />Thou be the kingly one,
<br />They'll set thee in their vanguard
<br />To lead them round the sun.

<h3><a id="IN_THE_WORKSHOP" name="IN_THE_WORKSHOP"></a>IN THE WORKSHOP.</h3>

<p>
Once in the Workshop, ages ago,
<br />The clay was wet and the fire was low.
<br />
<br />And He who was bent on fashioning man
<br />Moulded a shape from a clod,
<br />And put the loyal heart therein;
<br />While another stood watching by.
<br />
<br />"What's that?" said Beelzebub.
<br />"A lover," said God.
<br />And Beelzebub frowned, for he knew that kind.
<br />
<br />And then God fashioned a fellow shape
<br />As lithe as a willow rod,
<br />And gave it the merry roving eye
<br />And the range of the open road.
<br />
<br />"What's that?" said Beelzebub.
<br />"A vagrant," said God.
<br />And Beelzebub smiled, for he knew that kind.
<br />
<br />And last of all God fashioned a form,
<br />And gave it, what was odd,
<br />The loyal heart and the roving eye;
<br />And he whistled, light of care.
<br />
<br />"What's that?" said Beelzebub.
<br />"A poet," said God.
<br />And Beelzebub frowned, for he did not know.

Two shapes of august bearing, seraph tall,
<br />Of indolent imperturbable regard,
<br />Stood in the Tavern door to drink. As the first
<br />Lifted his glass to let the warm light melt
<br />In the slow bubbles of the wine, a sunbeam,
<br />Red and broad as smouldering autumn, smote
<br />Down through its mystery; and a single fleck,
<br />The tiniest sun-mote settling through the air,
<br />Fell on the grape-dark surface and there swam.
<br />
<br />Gently the Drinker with fastidious care
<br />Stretched hand to clear the speck away. "No, no!"&mdash;
<br />His comrade stayed his arm. "Why," said the first,
<br />"What would you have me do?" "Ah, let it float
<br />A moment longer!" And the second smiled.
<br />"Do you not know what that is?" "No, indeed."
<br />"A mere dust-mote, a speck of soot, you think,
<br />A plague-germ still unsatisfied. It is not.
<br />That is the Earth. See, I will stretch my hand
<br />Between it and the sun; the passing shadow
<br />Gives its poor dwellers a glacial period.
<br />Let it but stand an hour, it would dissolve,
<br />Intangible as the color of the wine.
<br />There, throw it away now! Lift it from the sweet
<br />Enveloping flood it has enjoyed so well;"
<br />(He smiled as only those who live can smile)
<br />"Its time is done, its revelry complete,
<br />Its being accomplished. Let us drink again."

<br />Bobolincolns in the meadows,
<br />Leisure in the purple shadows,
<br />
<br />Till the poppies without number

<br />Every unreluctant lover.
<br />
<br />Not a night but some brown maiden
<br />Bettered all the dusk she strayed in,

<br />
<br />Oh, but life went gayly, gayly,

<br />
<br />Mean, ill-windowed, damp, and wormy,

<br />There the hearth was always warm,

<br />There your comrade was your neighbor,

<br />
<br />And the board was always steaming,

<br />Not a plate but scoffed at porridge,
<br />Not a cup but floated borage.
<br />
<br />There were always jugs of sherry
<br />Waiting for the makers merry,

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
